        <h1>Rick and Morty</h1> <!-- Found this weird copypasta -->
            <p>To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewers head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. ðŸ˜‚<br>And yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid ðŸ˜Ž</p>

        <h1>Rick and Morty copypasta explanation</h1> <!-- Actually trying to explain the copypasta -->
        <p>The person says that you need to have a high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The show has jokes that relate to physics and the show itself is very complex. He also talks about Rick's personality, whose personality was apparently drawn from Narodanya Volya literature. As a common person, I do not know who that is, so it must be true. He goes on to say that Rick and Morty fans are smart and that people who hate on Rick and Morty and idiots. He goes on to mention how the catchphrase "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub" was a reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons, showcasing his intellectual superiority. He then pities us, imagining us "scratching our heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens". He is so devoted to the show that he has a Rick and Morty tattoo on him. He only shows it to the ladies, and they have to be as smart as him. He prefers them to be 5 IQ points below him. He then goes to say "Nothing personnel kid" absolutely destroying whoever he was targeting. Now, this is the end of the explanation. I hope you have enjoyed the Brainrot you just consumed. I will submit more assignments and see you later. Goodbye.
